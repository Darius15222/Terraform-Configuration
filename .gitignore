# 1. Terraform Mechanics (Heavy folders)
# The .terraform folder contains big provider plugins. 
# You don't need to save this; 'terraform init' recreates it.
.terraform/
.terraform.lock.hcl

# 2. Terraform State (SENSITIVE - Do Not Commit)
# These files contain your private keys, passwords, and IP addresses.
# Committing them is a major security risk.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
*.tfstate.backup

# 3. Crash Logs
crash.log
crash.*.log

# 4. Sensitive Variables (CRITICAL - Contains your admin IP!)
# NEVER commit terraform.tfvars - it contains your admin IP address
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json
!terraform.tfvars.example

# 5. Project Specific - Generated Secrets
# The SSH key your code creates. Never commit private keys!
lab-key.pem
*.pem

# 6. Terraform Plan files (Optional, but good practice)
*.tfplan
*.tfplan.json

# 7. OS/Editor System Files
.DS_Store
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.bak
*~
